# Instanter - Natural Disaster Management System

Natural calamities and disasters may occur unannounced, but when they occur, they cause great loss to human life and property. During that period, each second is extremely crucial. Immediate action must be taken to avoid damage. People can call for help but the communication of sufficient information is not guaranteed.  During critical times of disaster, we need to quickly identify the areas of high impact, the number of affected people and what help they need. 

Instanter provides an end-to-end solution to provide information and resources to people who are affected by natural disasters.
It takes input like type of disaster, number of people affected, and voice message description, then sends it to NDRF for optimized resource allocation. This will help NDRF to handle such situations more effectively and make life easier for victims.
